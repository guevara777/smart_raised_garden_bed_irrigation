# A smart raised garden bed Irrigation-Solution
A smart raised garden bed irrigation-control with home assistant and esphome. This is my first own project - so please be kind :)

## What is this?
IÂ´ve created a smart raised garden bed irrigation-control to use with home assistant. I use different parts for this. The watering-solution is a cheap "plug-and -play-pump-in-a-water-tank"-solution from a discounter. Once it is connected to power the pump pumps water for 1-minute every 12 hours. I use an wifi-controlled socket to power it on and off. After powering it on it pumps water for 1 minute and the 12-hour timer starts. Since i want the pump to work more often then every 12 hours, i power the plug off after the pumps finishes its 1-minute-work and power it on every 60 minutes (could be any time you wish). So i do have control over the amount of water that will go to the raised garden bed.

If the tank runs out of water, the bottom-water-level-sensor will notice that and control my zigbee-controlled water-outled to fill the tank up. The upper water-level-sensor will notice that the tank is full and close the water-outlet.
